# Contributions

1.  The SRNI-CAR dataset not only consolidates industry news, development insights, automotive marketing data, consumer online reviews, and sales information but also introduces valuable variables previously absent, such as model launch dates and brand inception dates. Therefore, it supports a broader spectrum of research possibilities compared to existing publicly available datasets in the automotive domain. Furthermore, it enhances analytical accuracy and interpretability. 
2.  The SRNI-CAR dataset possesses substantial business value in the automotive sector. Sales data aids automakers and marketers in discerning market trends, while review data facilitates the identification of consumer preferences, evaluation of marketing effectiveness, and product strengths and weaknesses analysis. Incorporating industry news, development insights, and automotive publicity empowers automakers to grasp industry trends and market competition.
